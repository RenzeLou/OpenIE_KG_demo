ground_truth_biomarkers = False # whether to use ground truth biomarkers
# if true:
## use ground truth biomarkers, and all the relation can match the nodes (because all extracted relations' nodes are from ground truth biomarkers, or forced to be aligned with them)
## but the drawback is that there is no model explanation, as sll the biomarkers are human-annotated, instead of model predicted
# if false (recommended):
## use model predicted biomarkers, however, relations' nodes may not match the predicted biomarkers, so I'll display both (for example, A1, A2, A3 biomarkers, A1->B1, A2->B2 relations, both A1, A2, A3 and B1, B2 will be displayed)
## But the benifit is that biomarker can have model explanation, and it aligns with our objective --- use model to predict potential biomarkers that even human may miss
## also in real-world, there is no ground truth biomarkers, when we predict biomarkers and predict the relation based on the predicted biomarkers, there will be no issues (e.g., predict A1, A2, A3 biomarkers, then relations must be among A1, A2, A3)
